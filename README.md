# Lab Code for DTU Course *Hardware/Software Codesign* (02214)

This repository contains lab code for the DTU course *Hardware/Software Codesign* (02214).

 * `keywords`: [Week 2: Keyword Spotter](keywords/README.md). This is the first lab, which is primarily about installing all the tools on your computer. It also provides a complete example of an ML application for the Seeed Studio ESP32-S3 Sense board, and you're welcome to reuse code snippets from the application for your project.
 * `camera`: [Week 3: Image Data Collection](camera/README.md). This is the second lab, which is an exercise in systematic data collection practices. The code provides a simple ESP32-S3 application that captures images with the camera, once per second, and dumps the image data on the serial port over USB. It includes camera driver code that you're welcome to reuse for your project. An accompanying simple Python application receives the images and allows you to save the images to disk.

More detailed instructions in the README.md files for each lab. These instructions are also available on the <a href="https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/home/296896">course page at DTU Learn</a>.
